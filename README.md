Hello to you.

Unfotunately working full time and being a father leaves me not much time to focus on personal projects, so it might be a little outdated here, last project was just an exercise to get a better grip of Vue+Pinia+Typescript.

Some technologies that I have a good experience to help any team are:

— Vue.Js

— JavaScript

— NodeJS (express + CRUD)

— React

— MongoDB (simple CRUD)

— Git (Gitlab and GitHub)

— WordPress (and legacy php)
