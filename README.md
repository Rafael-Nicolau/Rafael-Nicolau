Hello to you.

Please, consider that I don’t mind showing my weakness, my learning curves and what I do to study.

So, you’ll find here many repositories that it’s just me reminding and learning again stuff that in all these years I’ve not had much contact, I just like to let it here to remind me of what I can accomplish. 

I started when I was 11 with HTML 4, I used a LOT of Microsoft Frontpage, Shockwave, frames (wasn’t even Iframes back then, just frames) and a lot of code on one single HTML file, learned a bit of Pascal and Delphi back then and an almost dead code language called “COBOL”

Years later I self-taught myself in PHP and WORDPRESS, made a few websites with it, which unfortunately I can’t post here due to copyright issues (I was a freelancer for a famous Brazilian company who don’t want to show its clients that relies on freelancers… shame on you!) And if you read all this, then congratulations, you now probably want to talk to me, you can reach me through my only email: nicolaurafael@hotmail.com

See you.
